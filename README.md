# Real-time ASP.NET with SignalR - ReactJS Chat Application

### WebSockets are a great technology when you need to keep your clients synchronized with changes from your server.
### This is really useful when dealing with messages and notifications that need to be seen in real-time.
### SignalR is Microsoft’s technology that makes it easy to implement real-time applications.
### And the greatest thing is that you don’t need to install any third-party packages because it is already embedded in the .NET Core framework.
### Also, for the front-end part, it is not so difficult either to implement and use WebSockets connections from your API.
